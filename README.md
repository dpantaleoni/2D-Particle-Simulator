2D-Particle-Sim is a 2D N-body gravitational simulation that models particles interacting via Newtonian gravity. It includes three implementations: a C version using pthreads, a Python version using multiprocessing + shared memory + NumPy, and a C++ version with real-time visualization via raylib and optional GPU acceleration. Each implementation supports a configurable number of particles, runs for a fixed number of timesteps, and reports total simulation time for performance comparison across languages and architectures.
